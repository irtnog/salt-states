                Most elements defined in the UK federation label namespace
                are basic labels: empty elements whose presence or absence
                is all that is important.

        <!--
            No content elements are defined, so a basicLabel may contain
            neither text nor nested elements.

                A datedLabel is like a basicLabel, but with a single
                additional mandatory date attribute.

                asserted to the UK federation that the entity provides
                user accountability in terms of the definition given
                in section 6 of the federation's Rules of Membership.

                Indicates the software used to implement the entity, and
                optionally both general and specific indications of the
                version of software used.  This information is added to
                an entity only if it has been received from the deployer
                of the entity on the indicated date.
                
                This information is used in entity fragment files only,
                and is not included in the metadata published by the
                UK federation.  Its principal use is in classifying
                entities for statistical purposes.

                                by the federation statistics scripts.

                                only be specific enough to identify the broad functionality
                                of the entity, for example "1.3" vs. "2.0" would be sufficient
                                for Shibboleth entities.
